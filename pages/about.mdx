# About The Cuentos

Hola! I'm [Lucio](https://luciovilla.com) and I built and run The Cuentos. The goal of this website is to gather advice for and by first generation Latinos. The idea for it sparked when I realized that I was repeatingly passing down the same advice to my siblings and other first-gen students about topics like financial aid, negotiating salaries and internships. That is when I realized that there should be a place where other first-gen Latinos could share their advice and a resource for those who seek adivce.

## Submissions

For now, submissions are not displayed until I approve them. I want to make sure that there aren't any duplicating advice.

## Contact

This website is still a work in progress so contact me if you have any questions, feedback or if you'd like to help. hola@thecuentos.com
